                    <p class="large text-muted">Professionally, I'm a civic product manager / service designer living in Boston. Even though I love civic tech, I began my tech career alongside the budding sharing economy. As a result, I firmly believe that society's most underutilized resource is its people. My super secret tactics for improving government and our social fabric include fully-focused listening, working together with others, asking "Why?", and being positive. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessebiroscak">Here's my LinkedIn</a> if you want achievement-oriented details.</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">Personally, I'm husband to Maggie and dada to Mila (Me-la). I'm an excessively proud native San Franciscan, and I wish SF hadn't gotten so expensive. Boston - still cheaper than SF - is my home now, and I love the wide range of people living in this City. After work, you can find me playing with Mila, grilling up some dinner, tending my garden, or claiming I'm woodworking.</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">Want to talk about the value propositions of cities? Post-growth economics? Power tools? Which vegetables to plant as natural pesticides? How to build a secret passageway? I'm game. <a href="#contact">Just say hi</a>.</p>
